> "Elixir is my gateway into true functional programming. It moves away from imperative thinking, encouraging clean, expressive code and embracing the powerful philosophy of 'let it fail' â€” making systems resilient by design."

## ðŸ§ª About Elixir

Elixir is a **dynamic, functional programming language** designed for building **scalable and maintainable applications**. It runs on the **Erlang VM (BEAM)**, which is famous for creating **low-latency, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems**. Elixir emphasizes **immutability**, **pattern matching**, and **concurrency**, making it ideal for building real-time, resilient backend systems.

## ðŸ“¦ This Repository Covers:

- Elixir basics and syntax
- Functional programming concepts
- Conditionals and control flow
- Looping with recursion
- Pattern matching
- Primitive and complex data types
- Functions (single & multi-clause), higher-order functions
- Data manipulation using `Enum` and `Stream` modules

## ðŸ§  Why I Use Elixir

I was introduced to Elixir by someone experienced in distributed systems, and it immediately clicked. The **lightweight concurrency model**, **fault tolerance**, and **clean, functional style** opened my mind to writing more maintainable and concurrent code â€” lessons that even translate well into other languages like **Go**.
